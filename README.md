### Customer Segmentation Classification with KNN and Random Forest

### Project Description

This repository demonstrates customer segmentation using machine learning. We classify customers into groups based on their data. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Random Forest** classifiers are used to compare performance.

## Dataset

- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/customer-segmentation
- **Main Features:** Age, Work Experience, Family Size, etc.
- **Preprocessing:** Imputing missing values, scaling numerical values, one-hot encoding

## Methods

- **KNN**: Assigns classes based on the nearest data points.
- **Random Forest**: Uses multiple decision trees for robust classification.
- Includes cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning using grid search.

## Results

- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualizations: confusion matrix
- Comparison of KNN and Random Forest performance
